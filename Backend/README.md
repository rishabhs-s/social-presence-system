**To Run the backend**

docker-compose up --build run the project. This installs go and postgres which are needed for this.


**API endpoints** 

All the API endpoints are given in postman collection here- https://www.postman.com/lunar-eclipse-960237/workspace/supergaming/request/29875335-2bffabfd-2c46-40b6-ab13-41996de003ed?action=share&creator=29875335&ctx=documentation


**Setup to Run APIs**

Create more than 2 users. 
Now you can use the username of these users to call most of the APIs. Currently there is no JWT token, so no auth is required.
