<h1>Social Presence System</h1>

<h2>To Run the backend</h2>

**docker-compose up --build** to run the project. This installs go and postgres which are needed for this.


<h2>API endpoints</h2>

All the API endpoints are given in postman collection here- https://www.postman.com/lunar-eclipse-960237/workspace/supergaming/request/29875335-2bffabfd-2c46-40b6-ab13-41996de003ed?action=share&creator=29875335&ctx=documentation


<h2>Setup to Run APIs</h2>

Create more than 2 users. 
Now you can use the username of these users to call most of the APIs. Currently there is no JWT token, so no auth is required.
